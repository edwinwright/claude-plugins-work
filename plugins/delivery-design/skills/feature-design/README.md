# feature-design

Transforms a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into a Technical Specification by running a virtual dev team of specialist subagents.

## When to use

Use this after `feature-brief` has produced a PRD. It is step two of the feature pipeline:

```
feature-brief → feature-design → feature-plan → feature-tickets
```

Do not run this skill if the PRD has unresolved Open Questions — resolve them first. The tech spec is built on top of what the PRD states.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PRD | Yes | From `feature-brief`, as a file or pasted content |
| Tech stack constraints | No | Paste inline or attach a doc. If omitted, the Architect recommends a stack. |

## Output

A Technical Specification saved as a Markdown file, covering:

- Architecture decisions (stack, components, API approach, data model)
- Frontend design (components, state, API contract requirements)
- Backend design (API, data model, business logic, security, error handling)
- Test strategy (acceptance scenarios, integration tests, edge cases)
- Consolidated open questions

## How it works

The skill runs four subagents in sequence, then synthesises their outputs:

```
Architect
    ↓ (architecture decisions)
Frontend Engineer + Backend Engineer  ← run in parallel
    ↓ (FE spec + BE spec)
QA Engineer
    ↓ (test strategy)
Main agent synthesises → Technical Specification
```

1. **Architect** — reads the PRD and tech constraints; decides stack, components, API style, and data model sketch; sets constraints for the rest of the team
2. **Frontend Engineer** — designs components, state management, and defines the API contract the frontend needs
3. **Backend Engineer** — designs the API, data schema, business logic, and security (runs in parallel with Frontend)
4. **QA Engineer** — writes acceptance scenarios, integration test requirements, and edge cases from all prior outputs
5. **Main agent** — consolidates everything into a single Technical Specification, resolves FE/BE conflicts, surfaces open questions

## Usage guidelines

This skill is the most resource-intensive step in the pipeline — five agents run in sequence. Expect it to take several minutes.

| Agent | Model | Effort | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| Architect | claude-sonnet-4-6 | High | Sets hard constraints for the entire team — thoroughness matters here |
| Frontend Engineer | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Medium | Structured spec work; Architect's decisions reduce ambiguity |
| Backend Engineer | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Medium | As above |
| QA Engineer | claude-sonnet-4-6 | Medium | Derives tests from prior outputs; no novel reasoning required |

The **main orchestrating agent** (the session you run the skill in) handles coordination and synthesis. **claude-sonnet-4-6** is recommended for the session model — the heavy lifting is done by the subagents.

If you have a large or architecturally complex PRD, consider upgrading the Architect subagent to **claude-opus-4-8** for richer decision-making. The SKILL.md controls this — edit the Architect step if needed.

## Pipeline

```
feature-brief     →     feature-design     →     feature-plan     →     feature-tickets
idea → PRD              PRD → Tech Spec          Tech Spec → Plan        Plan → tickets
```

**Next step:** Pass the saved Tech Spec to `feature-plan`.

> If the Tech Spec contains unresolved Open Questions, resolve them before continuing. They will affect how delivery is sequenced.
