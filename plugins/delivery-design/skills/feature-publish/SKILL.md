description: 'Publish locally generated ticket files to a connected project management tool (Linear or GitHub Issues). Use this skill after feature-tickets has generated local .md files and the user has reviewed them. Triggers include: "publish the tickets", "push tickets to Linear", "create GitHub issues from the ticket files", "upload the tickets", or any time the user is ready to create tickets in their project management tool after reviewing local files. This is the fifth and final step in the feature pipeline: feature-brief → feature-design → feature-plan → feature-tickets → feature-publish.'

# feature-publish

You are publishing locally generated ticket files to the user's connected project management tool.

This is step five of the feature pipeline:

1. **feature-brief** — idea → PRD
2. **feature-design** — PRD → Technical Specification
3. **feature-plan** — PRD + Tech Spec → Delivery Plan
4. **feature-tickets** — Delivery Plan → local ticket files
5. **feature-publish** (this skill) — local ticket files → Linear or GitHub Issues

---

## Step 1: Read the ticket files

Read all files in the `tickets/` subfolder. When a project folder is connected, this is:

```
docs/features/<feature-slug>/tickets/
```

If no project folder is connected, ask the user where the ticket files are saved.

Identify:

- The Epic file (`_epic.md`)
- All Story files (all other `.md` files)

Parse the frontmatter of each file to extract structured metadata:
- `ticket_type` — `epic`, `story`, or `technical`
- `phase` — the delivery phase number
- `depends_on` — list of story filenames this story is blocked by
- `epic` — the epic filename this story belongs to

If the `tickets/` folder is empty or missing, tell the user and stop.

---

## Step 2: Detect the project management tool

Check which project management MCP is connected. Supported tools:

- **Linear** — use if the Linear MCP is available
- **GitHub Issues** — use if the GitHub MCP is available

If both are connected, ask the user which to use. If neither is connected, tell the user and stop — this skill requires a connected tool to create tickets.

---

## Step 3: Confirm the destination

Ask the user:

> **Which project / team / repo should these tickets be created in?**

For Linear: ask for the team name or identifier.
For GitHub: ask for the repository (owner/repo).

---

## Step 4: Present the publish plan

Present a summary of what will be created:

- The Epic title
- Each story title, type (Story or Technical), phase, and dependencies
- The total count

Ask: "Ready to publish these [N] tickets to [tool]? This cannot be undone easily — make sure the files look right first."

Wait for explicit confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 5: Create the Epic

Read the `_epic.md` file. Create the Epic in the project management tool.

**Linear**: Create an Issue of type Epic (or the equivalent in the connected workspace) in the specified team.
**GitHub Issues**: Create a Milestone in the specified repository.

Use the markdown body of `_epic.md` (excluding frontmatter) as the description. Use the `# Epic: [Title]` heading as the ticket title.

Save the Epic ID or URL — you will link each Story to it.

---

## Step 6: Create the Stories

For each story file, create a Story ticket linked to the Epic.

Use the markdown body (excluding frontmatter) as the ticket description. Use the `# [Story Title]` heading as the ticket title.

Apply labels based on frontmatter:
- `ticket_type: technical` → label the ticket as technical
- `phase` → add a phase label (e.g. `phase-1`, `phase-2`)

Create stories in phase order — `phase: 1` Technical stories first, then feature stories, then higher phases.

Save each ticket's ID or URL mapped to its filename — you will need this when linking dependencies.

---

## Step 7: Link dependencies

Once all tickets are created, update dependency links between stories using the tool's native relations.

For each story with a non-empty `depends_on` list:
- Look up the ticket ID for each filename listed in `depends_on`
- Create a "blocked by" relation from this story to each dependency

**Linear**: Use issue relations (blocks / blocked-by).
**GitHub Issues**: Add a linked issue comment if native blocking relations are not available.

---

## Step 8: Confirm and summarise

Present the user with:
- A link to the Epic
- A list of all created Story links, in phase order
- The dependency order (which stories to start first)

Tell the user:

> "All tickets are created. Phase 1 stories marked Technical should be picked up first — they unblock everything else. When you are ready to execute a story, pass it to an agent with the relevant codebase context."

## Tool field mapping

| Story field | Linear | GitHub Issues |
|---|---|---|
| Epic | Parent issue (Epic type) | Milestone |
| Story type | Issue type: Story | Label: `story` |
| Technical type | Issue type or label: `technical` | Label: `technical` |
| Phase | Label: `phase-1`, `phase-2`, etc. | Label: `phase-1`, `phase-2`, etc. |
| Dependencies | Issue relations: blocks / blocked-by | Linked issues (with comment if needed) |
| Description | Issue body | Issue body |
