# delivery-design

A Claude Code plugin that takes an idea through product → feature → tickets → publish, with all source-of-truth documents co-located with the code.

> [!model] Mental Model
> - **One source of truth: local markdown files in the repo.** Linear and other tools are sync targets, never the source.
> - **Docs that explain the code live with the code.** Decision records, glossary, domain model, agent instructions — in-repo.
> - **A doc is worth writing only if its "why" can't be recovered from the code.** That single test gates every decision record.
> - **Don't invent formats that already have standards.** Agent context → `AGENTS.md`. Decisions → Decision Record. Cross-feature scope → Initiative.
> - **Skills handle procedures; `AGENTS.md` handles always-true rules.** Only put things in `AGENTS.md` that are short, always-true, and non-inferable from the code.

## The two workflows

```
PRODUCT workflow   (new product — bootstraps the early SDLC)
  idea
   ├─ product-brief   → docs/product/vision.md + docs/product/product-backlog.md
   ├─ domain-doc      → docs/product/glossary.md + docs/product/domain-model.md
   └─ (output)        → product-backlog.md (one entry per feature, MoSCoW prioritised)
                          │
                          ▼
FEATURE workflow   (your existing pipeline — per backlog item)
  feature-brief → feature-design → feature-plan → feature-tickets → feature-publish
  idea → PRD        PRD → spec      spec → plan     plan → files      files → Linear/GitHub
```

**New product:** run the product workflow, then push each backlog item through the feature workflow.
**New feature on an existing product:** skip straight to `feature-brief`.

## Skill roster

| Skill | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `feature-brief` | ships | idea → PRD |
| `feature-design` | ships | PRD → Tech Spec; emits/updates `AGENTS.md` |
| `feature-plan` | ships | PRD + Tech Spec → Delivery Plan |
| `feature-tickets` | ships | Delivery Plan → local ticket files |
| `feature-publish` | ships | local files → Linear or GitHub Issues |
| `decision-record` | ships | MADR-style; `architecture` / `product` / `process` scope; significance gate |
| `domain-doc` | ships | bootstraps and maintains `glossary.md` + `domain-model.md` |
| `product-brief` | ships | idea → Product Brief + `product-backlog.md` |
| `feature-request` | ships | intake triage; the front door before `feature-brief` |
| `statement-of-work` | planned | commercial scope doc for contractor engagements |
| `handover` | planned | engagement-close index over pipeline artefacts |
| `initiative-brief` | planned | group-of-features layer (deferred until real need) |

## Install / use

Each skill is distributed as a `.skill` zip bundle in `dist/`. Load them into Claude Code:

1. Open Claude Code settings → Skills
2. Click **Install from file**
3. Select the `.skill` bundle from `dist/`

Or install all at once by pointing Claude Code at the `dist/` directory.

Skills trigger on natural language — see each skill's `README.md` for trigger phrases.
